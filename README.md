# DELTARUNE-Battle-Engine
 The first public Game Maker Studio 2 DELTARUNE Battle Engine repository made by Animelici804.
 The engine is currently unfinished, so there will be some updates.
 
### The features I am planning to add;
- Other Heroes Support (Kris and Ralsei)
- Buttons (FIGHT, ACT, ITEM, SPARE, MAGIC)
- 3 Enemies Support (That means you will be able to put 3 Rudinns in one battle!)
- Pacify and Spare Support (That means you can make the enemies tired and spareable.)
- Battle Faces (That means your characters will talk during battle!)
- GMU Console Support (From UNDERTALE Engine by TML)
- Overworld Support (Coming in very very long time.)
- Battle Transitions (That means you will be able to trigger battle transitions!)

I am looking forward to your fan-games that use this engine!
